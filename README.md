Screwing on conveyor belt
In this study, a screw fastening operation was performed. The cover model, which will move on the conveyor, was designed using SolidWorks. For the screw fastening points, only the main reference point was taught, and the other points were reached by shifting along the X, Y, and Z axes. The code written in Melfa Basic V was executed successfully.
